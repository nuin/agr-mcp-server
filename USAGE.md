   - Avoid: "breast cancer gene"

2. **Specify Species**: Include organism when relevant
   - Good: "mouse Trp53 gene"
   - Good: "human TP53 orthologs"

3. **Use Standard Identifiers**: Include database prefixes
   - Human: HGNC:1100
   - Mouse: MGI:104537
   - Fly: FB:FBgn0000043

4. **Combine Multiple Approaches**: Build comprehensive analyses
   - Start with gene search
   - Get detailed information
   - Find orthologs and interactions
   - Review literature

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gene Not Found**
   - Try alternative gene symbols
   - Check species-specific databases
   - Use broader search terms

2. **No Ortholog Data**
   - Some genes may not have characterized orthologs
   - Try related gene family members
   - Check different species combinations

3. **Limited Expression Data**
   - Expression data varies by species
   - Try different developmental stages
   - Check alternative expression resources

4. **API Timeouts**
   - Large queries may take time
   - Break complex analyses into steps
   - Retry if connection issues occur

### Getting Help

- Check gene identifiers in source databases
- Verify species names and abbreviations
- Consult Alliance Genome Resources documentation
- Use simpler queries for complex analyses
